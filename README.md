The working of device is demostrated on video which is loaded on YouTube at following link:

During of Master's Degree in Information Engigneering for Digital Medicine, we must procude as a final projct of course named "Embeeded system for E-Health"a smart medical device, that must to be able to recognize health parameters from patient body and raise same alert in case of out range value.

To realize our project you need:
- NUCLEO F4 series board
- MAX32664 sensor of heart rate and oxygen saturation
- DS1307 eternal clock to recognize the correct timestamp
- KY028 analog temeperature sensor
- Buzzer
- LED
- Resistence 220Î©


Our project implement interfaces:
- UART
- I2C
- ADC
- TIM

We deliver to you also 3D fils in .stl to replicate our struct, notetd that the print resolution must to be 0.3 mm for the boardCase and sensorCase, and also you can change resolution to 0.12 mm for oledCase
