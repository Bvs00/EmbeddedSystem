# Health Parameters Monitoring: A Revolutionary Device

Introducing a groundbreaking device designed for monitoring vital health parameters of patients. Developed by Apicella Salvatore and Bove Simone as part of their Master's Degree in Information Engineering for Digital Medicine, this smart medical device aims to revolutionize the field of E-Health.

To get a comprehensive understanding of our device, we have created a detailed demonstration video available on YouTube. You can watch the video by following this link: [Health Parameters Monitoring Demo](https://youtu.be/dmGpjHjMtrc)

## The Project Overview

As the final project for our "Embedded System for E-Health" course, we set out to create a state-of-the-art medical device capable of accurately monitoring health parameters and raising alerts in the event of any out-of-range values.

To bring our vision to life, we utilized the following components:

- NUCLEO F4 series board
- MAX32664 heart rate and oxygen saturation sensor
- DS1307 external clock for precise timestamp recognition
- KY028 analog temperature sensor
- Buzzer
- LED
- 220Î© Resistance

## Cutting-Edge Interfaces

Our project implements various interfaces to ensure seamless functionality and data communication. These interfaces include:

- UART
- I2C
- ADC
- TIM

## Replicating the Device

To help you replicate our device, we are providing 3D files in .stl format. These files will enable you to recreate the structure accurately. Please note that for the boardCase and sensorCase, we recommend a print resolution of 0.3 mm, while for the oledCase, a resolution of 0.12 mm can be used.

With our device, the future of health monitoring is at your fingertips. Experience the power of technology in transforming patient care and ensuring timely interventions. Together, let's embark on a journey toward a healthier world.
